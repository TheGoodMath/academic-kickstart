Welcome to TheGoodMath :)\nI’m happy you’re here because that means you have an interest in Mathematics.\n  Whether you have basic notions in math(s) or if you\u0026rsquo;re a mathematician, I hope you’ll find something useful reading the posts of this website.\nWhile a website about mathematics may seem boring, it turns out that many other people shared my dream of learning The Fundamentals of Mathematics.\nIf you want to learn more about math(s), you\u0026rsquo;re not alone and it\u0026rsquo;s never too late.\nTheGoodMath is all about supporting math(s) learners from around the world.\nThe Fundamentals of Mathematics Mathematics What\u0026rsquo;s the definition of mathematics?\nBelow, some examples are given.\nAristole,\n Mathematics is the science of quantity.\n Bertrand Russel,\n All Mathematics is Symbolic Logic.\n Henri Poincaré,\n Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.\n Encyclopædia Britannica,\n Mathematics is the science of structure, order, and relation that has evolved from elemental practices of counting, measuring, and describing the shapes of objects.\n So, the definition of mathematics can change according to at least :\n Period of Time School of Thought Mathematics as Art Mathematics as Science  Thus, it seems vain to find a consensus.\nHowever, not\n support fundings the importance of mathematics  Now, what is the definition of Mathematics in a dictionary?\nFrom Oxford Languages,\n The abstract science of number, quantity, and space, either as abstract concepts (pure mathematics), or as applied to other disciplines such as physics and engineering (applied mathematics).\n From Cambridge Dictionary,\n The study of numbers, shapes, and space using reason and usually a special system of symbols and rules for organizing them.\n From Merriam-Webster,\n The science of numbers and their operations, interrelations, combinations, generalizations, and abstractions and of space configurations and their structure, measurement, transformations, and generalizations.\n From The American Heritage,\n The study of the measurement, properties, and relationships of quantities and sets, using numbers and symbols.\n So, mathematics is:\n an abstract science the study of some topics using numbers and symbols related to abstract concepts (pure mathematics) related to applied concepts (applied mathematics)  Hence, here we\u0026rsquo;re going to use the following biased definition.\n Mathematics is the abstract science that study pure and applied concepts using numbers and symbols.   Fundamental What\u0026rsquo;s the definition of fundamental?\nFrom Oxford Languages,\n A central or primary rule or principle on which something is based.\n From Cambridge Dictionary,\n The main or most important rules or parts.\n From Merriam-Webster,\n Something serving as a basis supporting existence or determining essential structure or function.\n From The American Heritage,\n Something that is an essential or necessary part of a system or object.\n So, fundamental is:\n a central rule for something something essential a supporting basis  Here, we\u0026rsquo;re going to use the following biased (again) definition.\n Fundamental is a central supporting rule on which something is based.   Hence, combining both definitions of Mathematics and Fundamental, we obtain the following definition of The Fundamentals of Mathematics.\n The Fundamentals of Mathematics are the central supporting rules on which the abstract science that study pure and applied concepts using numbers and symbols is based.   Vision   VISION:\nGood World if and only if Good Math.   First, we explain here if and only.\nSo, the if part is \u0026ldquo;Good World if and only if Good Math.\u0026rdquo;.\nNow, we rearrange this statement in the form \u0026ldquo;If\u0026hellip;, then\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; which gives\n$$\\text{If Good Math, then Good World.}$$\nTherefore, it follows that the only if part is\n$$\\text{If Good World, then Good Math.}$$\nHence, the concise form of writing these two statements is\n$$\\text{Good World} \\iff \\text{Good Math.}$$\nGood World What is it meant by Good World ?\nBelow, a non exhaustive list of what living in a Good World might be.\n Universal access to Education Universal access to Research Universal access to Culture Highest level of Health Environment Caring Space Exploration Free Knowledge Social Progress Global Peace  Now, we try the\nHere, we mean:\n Peaceful place Equal Healthy environment  Now, we try to englobe\n Hence, by Good World it is meant a healthy Home.   Good Math  By Good Math, we mean:\n the importance of mathematics    Mission   MISSION:\nTo Learn the Beauty of the Fundamentals of:\n Pure Mathematics Applied Mathematics  with the help of:\n Tips \u0026amp; Tricks in Mathematics Math(s) Resources    So, TheGoodMath\u0026rsquo;s mission is to show the beauty of the fundamentals of abstract concepts (pure mathematics) and applied concepts (applied mathematics).\nAlso, if needed, we will find some tips and tricks to help learn these concepts but only after they have been understood.\nFinally, the math(s) resources of this website are continuously being updated.\nUpdates  Free  All the updates are free.
