## Which are the Natural Numbers $\mathbb{N}$?
The **Natural Numbers**, denoted by $\mathbb{N}$, are the counting numbers; that is,
$$1,2,3,\ldots .$$
So, $\mathbb{N}$ represents the set of all **Natural Numbers**; that is,
$$\mathbb{N}= \\{1,2,3,\ldots\\}.$$
This set $\mathbb{N}$ is equal to the set of positive integers, denoted by  $\mathbb{Z}^+$.

Thus,
$$\mathbb{N}=\mathbb{Z}^+.$$
### Is zero, 0, a Natural Number? :heart:
The number 0 
Now, zero represents the empty set; that is,
{{% alert warning %}}
Sometimes the number zero is included in the set $\mathbb{N}$.
{{% /alert %}}
So, the set of **Natural Numbers** would be
$$\mathbb{N}= \\{0,1,2,\ldots\\}.$$
Here, we are going to use the first definition.

Hence, the Natural Numbers denoted by $\mathbb{N}$ is the set
$$\mathbb{N}= \\{1,2,3,\ldots\\}.$$
