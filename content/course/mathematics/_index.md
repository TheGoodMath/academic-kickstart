TheGoodMath is much more than just 

While a website about mathematics may seem boring, – it turns out that many others shared my dream of making a living by writing on topics that they are passionate about and ProBlogger quickly grew to be a center for learning for hundreds of thousands of bloggers from around the world.

My name is TGM and I'm happy you're here because that means you have an interest in Mathematics.

Whether you're brand new to mathematics or you're a mathematician, I hope you'll find some value in the resource of 

My first personal blog grew in readership in the coming years to several thousand readers a month and gave me confidence to start numerous other niche-focused blogs which in the hope of paying for my server expenses I started to teach myself to make money from.

The income from those blogs was small at first – just a few dollars a week at first – but gradually grew to become a part time job and then in late 2004 to be a full-time income.
