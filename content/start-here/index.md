## Welcome :yum:

Hello There! Welcome to *TheGoodMath*.

I’m happy you’re here because that means you have an interest in *Mathematics*.

{{< figure library="true" src="TheGoodMath.png" width="250px" float="right" >}}

Whether you have basic notions or if you're a mathematician, I hope you’ll find something useful reading the posts of this website.

While a website about mathematics may seem boring, it turns out that **many people shared my dream** of *learning* and *sharing*:
$$\textbf{The Fundamentals of Mathematics}$$

If you want to learn more about math(s), you're not alone and <a href="javascript:;" onclick="ml_account('webforms', '2301916', 'g1t2k6', 'show')">
it's Never too Late</a>:rocket:

TheGoodMath is all about supporting learners from around the world.

## The Fundamentals of Mathematics

### Mathematics

**First**, what's Mathematics?

**Below**, some examples are given.

**Aristole**,

> Mathematics is the science of quantity.

**Bertrand Russel**,

> All Mathematics is Symbolic Logic.

**Henri Poincaré**,

> Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.

**Encyclopædia Britannica**,

> Mathematics is the science of structure, order, and relation that has evolved from elemental practices of counting, measuring, and describing the shapes of objects.

**So**, the definition of mathematics can change according to *at least* :

- Period of Time
- School of Thought
- Mathematics as Art
- Mathematics as Science

**Thus**, it seems vain to find a consensus.

**However**, not answering this question might tend to:

- public image degradation of the subject
- potential talents demotivation
- loss of fundings
- lack of support

**Now**, what's the definition of Mathematics in a *dictionary*?

**Oxford Languages**,

> The abstract science of number, quantity, and space, either as abstract concepts (pure mathematics), or as applied to other disciplines such as physics and engineering (applied mathematics).

**Cambridge Dictionary**,

> The study of numbers, shapes, and space using reason and usually a special system of symbols and rules for organizing them.

**Merriam-Webster**,

> The science of numbers and their operations, interrelations, combinations, generalizations, and abstractions and of space configurations and their structure, measurement, transformations, and generalizations.

**The American Heritage**,

> The study of the measurement, properties, and relationships of quantities and sets, using numbers and symbols.

**So**, according to the main dictionaries above, mathematics is:

- an abstract science
- the study of some topics using numbers and symbols
- related to abstract concepts (pure mathematics)
- related to applied concepts (applied mathematics)

**Hence**, here we're going to use the following *biased* definition.
{{% alert note %}}
Mathematics is the abstract science that study pure and applied concepts using numbers and symbols.
{{% /alert %}}

### Fundamental

**Now**, what's the definition of *fundamental*?

**Oxford Languages**,

> A central or primary rule or principle on which something is based.

**Cambridge Dictionary**,

> The main or most important rules or parts.

**Merriam-Webster**,

> Something serving as a basis supporting existence or determining essential structure or function.

**The American Heritage**,

> Something that is an essential or necessary part of a system or object.

**So**, according to the main dictionaries above, fundamental is:

- a central rule for something
- something essential
- a supporting basis

**Here**, we're going to use the following *biased* (again) definition.
{{% alert note %}}

Fundamental is a central supporting rule on which something is based.

{{% /alert %}}

## Definition :nerd_face:

**Hence**, combining both definitions of *Mathematics* and *Fundamental*, we obtain the following definition of *The Fundamentals of Mathematics*.

{{% alert note %}}
**The Fundamentals of Mathematics** are the central supporting rules on which the abstract science that study pure and applied concepts using numbers and symbols is based.
{{% /alert %}}

## TheGoodMath's Vision :dart:

{{% alert note %}}
**Good World** *if and only if* **Good Math**.
{{% /alert %}}

**First**, we explain here the *if and only if* parts.

**So**, the *if part* is "Good World if ~~and only if~~ Good Math.".

**Now**, we rearrange this statement in the form *"If..., then..."* which gives

$$\text{If Good Math, then Good World.}$$

**Therefore**, it follows that the *only if* part is

$$\text{If Good World, then Good Math.}$$

**Hence**, the concise form of writing these two statements is
$$\text{Good World if and only if Good Math}$$
which using an abreviation gives
$$\text{Good World iff Good Math}$$
and using a symbole gives
$$\text{Good World} \iff \text{Good Math.}$$

### Good World :globe_with_meridians:

**However**, what do we mean by *Good World* ?

**Below**, a non exhaustive list of what living in a good world might tend to be.

- Universal access to Education
- Universal access to Research
- Universal access to Culture
- Highest level of Health
- Environment Caring
- Space Exploration
- Free Knowledge
- Social Progress
- Global Peace

**Now**, we try the

**Here**, we mean:

- Peaceful place
- Equal
- Healthy environment

Now, we try to englobe

{{% alert note %}}

Hence, by Good World, we mean a healthy home.

### Good Math :infinity:

By *Good Math*, we mean:

- the importance of mathematics

## TheGoodMath's Mission :fire:

### Minimal Version

{{% alert note %}}

To Learn The **Fundamentals of Mathematics**.

{{% /alert %}}

### Extended Version

**That is**, using the definition provided previously gives

{{% alert note %}}
To learn the central supporting rules on which the abstract science that study pure and applied concepts using numbers and symbols is based.
{{% /alert %}}

**Also**, if needed, we will find some tips and tricks to help learn these concepts but only after they have been understood.

**Finally**, the math(s) resources of this website are continuously being updated.
